## Building

We use cmake. Typically you would type:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

We rely on the `boost::program_options` which must be installed prior to
building the program. We also use modern C++ features, such that you will
require a modern compiler (tested with g++-4.9).

## Running

The code is run from the command line and a runcard must always be given as the
first argument:

`./celadro runcard.dat [options]`

A runcard is a simple file providing the parameters for the run. Example
runcards can be found in the `example/` directory. Every option can also be
given to the program using the command line as `./celadro runcard.dat --option=arg`.
A complete list of available options can be obtained by typing `./celadro -h`.

By default the program writes output files in the current directory. This can be
changed using `--output=dir/` or `-o dir/`, where `dir/` is the target
directory. The program also supports compressed (using zip) output with the option
flag `--compression` or `-c`. Typical usage is `./celadro runcard.dat -fco output/`

Type `./celadro -h` for a list of available options.

## Examples

Examples runs and ploting scripts can be found in the `example` directory. Try
to run `bash make_all_movies.sh` and have a look at the results.

## Multi-threading and CUDA

WARNING !!! this feature is currently unmaintained and can not be used for now (2020) !!!

The code supports both multi-threading and CUDA. The CUDA-enabled version of
the code can be built using
```
mkdir build-cuda
cd build-cuda
cmake ..
make celadro-cuda
```
